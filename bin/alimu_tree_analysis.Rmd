Using a decision tree, we classified each listing for whether or not the host is a "superhost".
After the initial EDA, we chose 16 variables for training the tree model. Since we have a sufficiently large number of observations in our dataset, we randomly divided the dataset into two partitions: training set and test set. About $\frac{5}{6}$ of the data is used for training and the remaining $\frac{1}{6}$ of the data is used for testing. 

When training the model, we used Gini index and Information Gain as entropy measures for developing the tree.

After training the model, we tested it on the testing dataset, resulting in an overall accuracy rate of 96.4% for both the Gini and Information Gain splitting indices.

# Remove points that do not have superhost status labeled
to.remove <- which(fra.selected.tree$host_is_superhost == "")
fra.selected.tree <- fra.selected.tree[-to.remove,]

fra.selected.tree <- droplevels(fra.selected.tree)

train <- sample(1:nrow(listings), 26000) 
test <- (-train)
tree.training <- fra.selected.tree[train,]
tree.testing <- fra.selected.tree[test,]

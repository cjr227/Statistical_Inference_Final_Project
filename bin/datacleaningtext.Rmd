#### Variables Included

From the original dataset we kept the following fields in something close to their original representation:  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
names(listings)[1:44]
```

*Id, host_id, latitude, longitude and is_location_exact were kept for plotting and reference purposes rather than analysis.*

In addition to these fields, we created 

* a count of the number of hosts at a location (based on names field)
* the distance (in meters) from a listing (based on lat/long) to the nearest subway station
* indicator variables for amenities in a listing
* indicator variables for host verifications
